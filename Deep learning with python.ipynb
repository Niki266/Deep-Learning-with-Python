    "For this project I will be following the the universal workflow of machine learning as demonstrated in Francois Chollet DLWP 4.5. Binary classification, which involves categorizing data into two classes, is a fundamental task in machine learning. In this project, we aim to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their textual content. We will work with the IMDB dataset, which consists of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. The dataset is divided into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing, with equal distribution between positive and negative reviews.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are conducting sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset, aiming to predict the sentiment associated with movie reviews. The input data for our analysis consists of movie reviews obtained from the IMDb dataset, while the prediction target is the sentiment label assigned to each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 What will our input data be?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"input_data\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data for the IMDb dataset consists of sequences of words representing movie reviews. These reviews have been preprocessed and converted into sequences of integers, where each integer corresponds to a specific word in a predefined dictionary.In other words, each movie review is represented as a sequence of integers, with each integer mapping to a particular word in the dictionary. This preprocessing step allows the machine learning model to work with numerical data, which is essential for training and making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the IMDb dataset in Keras, the input data will be in the form of these preprocessed sequences of integers. This format enables the model to learn patterns and relationships between words in the reviews and their associated sentiments (positive or negative). It's important to note that the IMDb dataset is split into separate training and test sets, each containing 25,000 reviews. This split ensures that the model is trained on one set of data and evaluated on a completely separate set, preventing overfitting and providing a reliable measure of its generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 What are we trying to predict?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"predict\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction target is the sentiment associated with each review, which is binary: positive or negative. Each review is labeled as either 1 (positive sentiment) or 0 (negative sentiment).We utilize separate training and test sets, with 25,000 reviews each, to train and evaluate our machine learning model. Each set contains an equal distribution of positive and negative reviews, ensuring a balanced dataset for training and evaluation. This separation ensures that the model's performance is assessed on unseen data, preventing overfitting and providing a reliable measure of its generalization capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The availability of both movie reviews and sentiment annotations (positive or negative labels) within the IMDb dataset enables the training of machine learning models for sentiment analysis tasks. Researchers and practitioners can utilize this dataset to develop and evaluate sentiment analysis algorithms effectively.Therefore, within the IMDb dataset, there is indeed data availability, which is crucial for training, predicting and evaluating sentiment analysis models accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of our sentiment analysis task is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. By leveraging the available data, which includes both movie reviews and sentiment annotations, our goal is to train a model that can generalize well to unseen data and effectively classify the sentiment of new movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 What type of problem are you facing?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"problem\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are facing with the IMDb dataset is binary classification. In binary classification, the task involves categorizing input data into one of two classes or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of IMDb dataset for sentiment analysis, the input data consists of movie reviews and the prediction target is the sentiment associated with each review, which is binary: either positive or negative.\n",
    "Therefore, the problem of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative sentiments falls under the category of binary classification. This understanding guides the choice of appropriate model architecture, loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy), evaluation metrics, and other aspects of the machine learning pipeline tailored specifically for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Hypothesis about Predictability -<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"predictability\"></a>\n",
    "I hypothesize that the outputs (sentiment labels) can be predicted given the inputs (movie reviews). The training data, testing data and restriction to the top 10,000 most frequent words should be sufficient enough to get the right predictability. This assumption forms the basis of our task, we believe that there exists a relationship between the textual content of movie reviews and their associated sentiment labels, which our deep learning model can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.5 Hypothesis about Data Informativeness -<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"informativeness\"></a>\n",
    "We hypothesize that the available data (movie reviews with sentiment annotations and restriction to the top 10,000 most frequent words) is sufficiently informative to learn the relationship between inputs (reviews) and outputs (sentiments). This assumption implies that the dataset contains representative examples that capture the variability and complexity of real-world movie reviews, enabling the model to generalize well to unseen data."

    "- The training loss (loss) steadily decreases over epochs, which indicates that the model is minimizing its error on the training data as training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The validation accuracy (val_acc) also increases initially but starts to slightly decrease towards the later epochs. This suggests that the model may be overfitting the training data, as it performs well on the training data but does not generalize as well to unseen validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The validation loss (val_loss) follows a similar trend as the validation accuracy, initially decreasing but then stabilizing or slightly increasing towards the end of training. This further supports the observation of potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overfitting occurs when a model learns to memorize the training data instead of generalizing from it. This often leads to high training accuracy but poor performance on unseen data. The discrepancy between training and validation performance is a common indicator of overfitting. The model's training accuracy reaches very high levels (close to 1.0), while the validation accuracy  slightly decreases. This suggests that the model is likely overfitting the training data."

    "We now effectively train the neural network model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content. The systematic investigation begins with the compilation of the model, where the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics are carefully selected. Subsequently, the model is trained over 20 epochs, with training and validation loss values recorded for analysis. Utilizing Matplotlib, the code generates a plot showcasing the training and validation loss trends over epochs. This visualization allows for the assessment of the model's learning dynamics, revealing insights into potential overfitting or underfitting."

    "The second plot starts by clearing the current figure (plt.clf()) to ensure a fresh plot. The accuracy values for both training and validation sets are extracted from the training history and stored in acc_values and val_acc_values variables, respectively.

    "The training loss decreases with every epoch, and the training accuracy increases with every epoch. It is what we would expect when running gradient descent optimization, the quantity we are trying to minimize should be less with every iteration. But that is not the case for the validation loss and accuracy, they seem to peak at the fourth epoch. A model that performs better on the training data is not necessarily a model that will do better on data it has never seen before. This means the model is <b><U>overfitting</U></b>, after the second epoch, we are overoptimizing on the training data, and you end up learning representations that are specific to the training data and don’t generalize to data outside of the training set.<b><U>We will fight this overfitting later in the code using some techniques.</U></b>"

    "\n",
    "Fighting overfitting refers to the process of implementing strategies or techniques to prevent a machine learning model from fitting too closely to the training data and instead encouraging it to generalize well to unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to capture noise or idiosyncrasies in the training data, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the most common ways to prevent overfitting in neural networks:\n",
    "- Get more training data.\n",
    "- Reduce the capacity of the network. \n",
    "- Add weight regularization.\n",
    "- Add dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the models size. At the same time, keep in mind that you should use models that have enough parameters that they don’t underfit. Lets replace the original baseline network with a smaller network.\n",

    "This model comprises a sequential stack of layers. The first layer is a densely connected layer with 4 units, utilizing the ReLU activation function. It expects input data of shape (batch_size, 10000), where each sample represents a review from the IMDb dataset encoded as a binary vector of length 10000, with each element indicating the presence or absence of a particular word in the review. The subsequent hidden layer is also a densely connected layer with 4 units and ReLU activation. The final layer is a single unit densely connected layer with a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a probability score between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the review being positive. This model architecture aims to capture complex relationships within the data and make accurate predictions regarding the sentiment of IMDb reviews.\n",

    "Scaling up and developing a model that overfits is crucial in the deep learning workflow to assess the model's capacity, detect signs of overfitting, optimize regularization and hyperparameters, and gain insights into the model's behavior and learning dynamics. By pushing the model to its limits, we can identify its maximum potential and refine it through regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning to strike the right balance between complexity and generalization, ultimately leading to the development of more robust and effective deep learning models."

    "The above model is a neural network model with two hidden layers, each consisting of 16 units. Regularization is applied to the kernel weights of these layers using L2 regularization with a penalty factor of 0.001. l2(0.001) means every coefficient in the weight matrix of the layer will add 0.001 * weight_coefficient_value to the total loss of the network. Note that because this penalty is only added at training time, the loss for this network will be much higher at training than at test time.The activation function used in the hidden layers is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). The input shape of the first layer is specified as (10000,), indicating that the input data has 10,000 features. Finally, a single-unit output layer with a sigmoid activation function is added to produce binary classification predictions. This regularization technique helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function based on the magnitude of the weights, encouraging smaller weights and reducing model complexity.\n",

    "The second model that will be used below incorporates L2 regularization with a penalty factor of 0.001 on the kernel weights of the hidden layers. Both models are compiled using the RMSprop optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. They are trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 512 and validated using the test data. Finally, the validation losses of both models are plotted to compare their performance. L2 regularization is expected to reduce overfitting by penalizing large weights in the model."

    "This validation loss comparison plot shows the impact of the L2 regularization penalty. As you can see, the model with L2 regularization (dots) has become much more resistant to overfitting than the reference model (crosses), even though both models have the same number of parameters. Initially, both models start with relatively high validation losses. However, as training progresses, the validation loss decreases for both models. The model with L2 regularization consistently maintains a lower validation loss compared to the baseline model without regularization, indicating that L2 regularization helps prevent overfitting by constraining the weights of the neural network."

    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting, dropout layers are inserted after each hidden layer in the IMDb dataset model. When a model works well on training data but is unable to generalise to fresh, untested data, this is known as overfitting. Randomly removing a different subset of neurons on each example would prevent conspiracies and thus reduce overfitting.Dropout layers assist the model in avoiding over-reliance on particular characteristics or patterns in the training data by arbitrarily removing a portion of the input units during the training process. In the end, this enhances the model's performance on test data that hasn't been seen and lowers the chance of overfitting by encouraging the model to acquire more reliable and generalizable representations of the data."

    "this is a clear improvement over the refer- ence network.The red crosses represent the validation loss of the model with dropout layers, while the blue circles represent the validation loss of the baseline model without dropout layers. The plot helps visualize how the dropout layers affect the training process and the generalization capability of the model. Typically, we expect to see a reduction in validation loss when dropout layers are added, indicating improved performance and better generalization to unseen data."

    "By doing extensive experimentation we can improve the model and find out what implementations work.We can then use hyperparameter tuning to deploy a model thats beats the baseline model. I have a total of 6 experiments.\n",

    "Please note that i have listed these as original code as i did not refer to anything while building them, however this experimentation is to improve the baseline model(from Chollet). The way i am building the code is different.\n",

    "#### 10.1. Experiment with one and three hidden layers.<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1_3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to investigate the performance of neural networks with one and three hidden layers on the IMDb dataset.By varying the number of hidden layers, we aim to understand how increasing the depth of the network affects its ability to learn and generalize from the data.The models are evaluated on the test set to assess their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the effects of using one hidden layer versus three hidden layers on validation and test accuracy, several factors can come into play. However, it's important to note that the impact can vary depending on the specific dataset and problem at hand. Here are some general justifications for how the number of hidden layers can affect model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "One Hidden Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity: Using only one hidden layer simplifies the model's architecture, making it easier to understand and interpret. With a simpler model, there is a lower risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalization: One hidden layer can be sufficient for capturing linear relationships and simpler patterns in the data. If the dataset exhibits a linearly separable structure, a single hidden layer may be able to learn and generalize well, resulting in good validation and test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduced Complexity: Fewer hidden layers mean fewer parameters to learn and optimize during training. This can result in faster training times and less computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three Hidden Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased Capacity: Additional hidden layers provide the neural network with more capacity to learn complex representations of the data. Deep architectures can capture hierarchical features and abstract patterns, potentially improving the model's ability to handle intricate relationships within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Representation Learning: Each hidden layer can learn and extract different levels of features and abstractions. As information passes through multiple layers, the network can progressively learn more meaningful representations of the data. This can be advantageous when dealing with complex datasets that require multiple layers of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential for Overfitting: The deeper the network, the higher the risk of overfitting, particularly when the dataset is small or noisy. Additional hidden layers introduce more parameters to learn, increasing the model's capacity to memorize training samples. Regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay can help mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Explanation -\n",
    "\n",
    "- We define a list containing the number of hidden layers to experiment with (one and three).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each number of hidden layers in the list, a neural network model is built using Sequential API in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model loops through each number of hidden layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model architecture includes an embedding layer, followed by one or three dense hidden layers with 16 units and ReLU activation functions, and an output layer with one unit and sigmoid activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The models are compiled with the rmsprop optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each model is trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 512 and a validation split of 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After training, each model is evaluated on the test set, and the test accuracy is printed.\n"

    "After testing and tuning with parameters and applying the experiments that i had done above i had created a model that shows higher accuracy perfectly without overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it was difficult for me to find out exactly which combination of parameters would give me the best accuracy, I created a grid of units,dropout_rate and learning_rate examples and performed a gridsearch with cross validation using GridSearchCV to get the best parameters. It also shows the best corresponding accuracy that we can get using these hyperparater combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works is that a grid of hyperparameters is defined using the param_grid dictionary. It includes different combinations of units, dropout rates, and learning rates to be explored during the grid search. The fit() method of the GridSearchCV function is called with the training data to perform the grid search with cross-validation. It searches through the specified hyperparameter grid (param_grid) to find the combination with the best performance on the training data. After the search is complete, it prints the best hyperparameters and their corresponding accuracy obtained from the grid search. \n",

    "When creating the model i took the help of my experiments which showed my the best learning rate, hidden units and layers and tanh activations but after getting several combinations wrong i decided to make the gridsearch."

    "- As seen the output generation, the training accuracy continues to increase over epochs, indicating that the model is fitting the training data very well. However, the validation accuracy decreases after a certain number of epochs. This difference between training and validation accuracies is a classic sign of overfitting.\n",

    "The plot compares the validation loss between the original model and the overfit model. The original model consists of a deep neural network with dense layers and dropout regularization, trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. Meanwhile, the overfit model employs a similar architecture but with larger units (512) and more complex layers, which can lead to overfitting. The validation loss of the overfit model is consistently higher than that of the original model, indicating poorer generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot illustrates how the validation loss evolves over epochs for both models. In the initial epochs, both models experience a decrease in validation loss, indicating improved performance. However, as training progresses, the overfit model starts to exhibit higher validation loss compared to the original model. This increase in validation loss suggests that the overfit model is overfitting to the training data, failing to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison highlights the importance of model complexity and regularization techniques in preventing overfitting, emphasizing the need to strike a balance between model capacity and generalization performance."

    "- You usually need to do quite a bit of preprocessing on your raw data in order to be able to feed it as tensors into a neural network. Sequences of words can be encoded as binary vectors, but there are other encoding options, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stacks of Dense layers with relu activations can solve a wide range of problems including sentiment classification, and you’ll likely use them frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a binary classification problem (two output classes), your network should end with a Dense layer with one unit and a sigmoid activation: the output of your network should be a scalar between 0 and 1, encoding a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With such a scalar sigmoid output on a binary classification problem, the loss function you should use is binary_crossentropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rmsprop optimizer is generally a good enough choice, whatever your problem. That’s one less thing for you to worry about. I found adam optimizer to be helpful as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As they get better on their training data, neural networks eventually start overfitting and end up obtaining increasingly worse results on data they’ve never seen before. Be sure to always monitor performance on data that is outside of the training set.\n",
