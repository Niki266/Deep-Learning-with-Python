# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews using Deep Learning ðŸŽ¥

This project implements the universal workflow of machine learning for binary classification. The goal is to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content. It leverages deep learning techniques to develop, train, and evaluate models for sentiment prediction.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Dataset**: Uses the IMDb dataset with 50,000 reviews, evenly split for training and testing.
- **Workflow**: Follows the universal workflow of machine learning, including:
  - Defining the problem and assembling a dataset.
  - Data preprocessing with techniques like vectorization and encoding.
  - Building baseline models and developing advanced models.
  - Model evaluation using multiple protocols and metrics.
  - Fighting overfitting with regularization techniques.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
- **Extensive Experimentation**:
  - Experimenting with different activation functions, loss functions, hidden layers, and learning rates.
  - Analyzing the impact of various configurations on model performance.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots for training/validation accuracy and loss.
